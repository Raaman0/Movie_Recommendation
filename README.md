This project is a **Hybrid Movie Recommendation System** built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, combining both **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to recommend movies to users.

## **Features**

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to a selected movie using movie attributes like genres, keywords, overview, cast, and crew.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Simulated user ratings used to recommend movies based on other usersâ€™ preferences.
- **Hybrid System**: Combines both approaches to provide more accurate recommendations.
- **Interactive Web App**: Users can input a movie title and select the number of recommendations via a **Streamlit interface**.
- **Visualization**: Optionally displays a heatmap showing content similarity between movies.
